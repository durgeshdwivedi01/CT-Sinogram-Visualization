# CT Sinogram Visualization
This repository contains a MATLAB tool for visualizing sinograms in CT with phantom images.
## Description
This tool creates a phantom image with circles and a diamond-shaped artifact and generates a sinogram by simulating the X-ray transmission through the phantom at different angles.
## Usage
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `CT_Sinogram_Visualization.m`.
3. Run `CT_Sinogram_Visualization.m`.
